Please note that you need to link against the libcurl library when compiling the C code. For example, if you are using GCC, you can compile the code with the following command:

Copy code
gcc -o program_name source_file.c -lcurl
Replace program_name with the desired name for the compiled program, and source_file.c with the name of the C source file.
