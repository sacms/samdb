In this code, we create an Express.js server with a single route (/) that calls the sacms function with the specified IP address and sends the response back to the client. Make sure to replace the accessToken variable with your actual Bearer Token.

To run the Express.js application, you need to have Node.js installed. Save the code in a file, for example server.js, and run node server.js in the terminal. The server will start listening on port 3000. You can access the API by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser. The response will be the result of the sacms function for the specified IP address, movie info & file info.
