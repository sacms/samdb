In Python, we can use the requests library to send HTTP requests, and the json library to encode the payload data as JSON. The post method is used to send a POST request with the provided URL, headers, and JSON data. The response is then returned as text.

Make sure to install the requests library if you haven't already by running pip install requests in your Python environment.
